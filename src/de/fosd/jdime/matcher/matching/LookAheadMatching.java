 * when lookahead is enabled, we may instead find a <code>Matching</code> for children of the <code>Artifact</code>s that
 * were passed in. To ensure that the concrete <code>Matcher</code>s work correctly and that the <code>Matching</code>
 * between the children is added in {@link Matcher#storeMatchings(MergeContext, Matchings, Color)} this class overloads
 * some methods of the <code>Matching</code> base class.
