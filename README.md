## System Requirements:
* git (http://git-scm.com/)

__Debian/Ubuntu:__  
`apt-get install git`

__Redhat/Fedora:__  
`yum install git`

__Suse/OpenSuse:__  
`zypper install git`

## Installation:
Clone the repository using `git clone $URL`.

JDime uses gradle as a build system.
To avoid version mismatches with already installed instances of gradle, you can use the supplied gradle wrapper `gradlew` that bootstraps the right version of gradle automatically.


After running `./gradlew installDist`, the directory `build/install/JDime/bin` will contain Unix and Windows scripts that you can use to start the application.

## Usage:
The input versions are passed to JDime as command line arguments. To perform a three-way merge, JDime is invoked as follows: 

`JDime --mode [unstructured|structured|autotuning] --output [file/directory] <leftVersion> <baseVersion> <rightVersion>`

Run `JDime --help` to show more extensive usage information.
